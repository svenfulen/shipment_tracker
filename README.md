# shipment_tracker
wgu capstone

This is a Shipment Tracker application that I built for my WGU capstone project using Java and JavaFX.
It is configured to communicate with a database to store shipment / customer information.

You will need to setup your own database locally or in the cloud if you want to run the code in this project.
